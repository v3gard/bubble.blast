Levels:
 - Each level should consist of X amounts of bubbles to burst
 - Bubbles should be able to appear simultaneously and sequentially
  - e.g. Two bubbles appear at level start. When either bubble is bursted,
    another appers
  - Bubble placing should not take into action when the user bursts a bubble.
    Placing of bubbles should be time based only. (e.g. one bubble appears at
    t=0, another at t=5, and a final at t=10)

Random coordinates:
 - The coordinates of the bubbles should be random. However, the bubbles should
   not be allowed to "collide" or overlap. This requires code that parses the
   locations and radiuses of existing bubbles and determining where to place
   the next.
 - The game map size must also be taken into consideration to avoid having
   bubbles appear off-screen (or half-wau off screen)
